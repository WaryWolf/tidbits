ChromeWrapper
=============

This is a simple wrapper around Selenium and a headless chrome/chromium instance that i threw together for automating mass-scanning of websites. It also comes with a simple REST API via Flask.

Requirements:

 - Linux (written/tested on ubuntu 16.04, other distros = YMMV)
 - chrome or chromium-browser
 - chromedriver

Python libraries used:
 - Selenium
 - Flask (for REST API)
 - validators (for REST API)
 - requests (for REST API client)
